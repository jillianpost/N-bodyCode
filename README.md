N-Body Gravitational Simulation

This project simulates gravitational interactions between particles using numerical integration methods developed in Astro 2600.

Features:
- Custom N-body solver
- Time-stepping integration
- Visualization of particle trajectories

Language: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
